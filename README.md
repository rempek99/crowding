## Description

Crowding is a project that I'm going to implement as my Engineer Work.

The main idea is an app that allows user to create different type of events like *I'm looking for people who will show
me some interesting places in this city*.

Other users see the events sorted by location and are able to sign in and chat with host and participants.

## Technology stack

* Back-End
    - Database: PostreSQL (?) latest

* Front-End
